# loadusc
Package to load all release-points of the United States Code as versions in XCiteDB

## Install Python 3.7, as a pyenv virtualenv named `v37`

## Install this package
To install from this directory, `pip install -e ./`

## Download releasepoints

Download all USC releasepoints into a directory called `USC_RELEASEPOINTS` with:

`$ python downloadusc.py `

This does two things:
 
    * Download the releasepoints, each in its directory, to the `constants.USC_RELEASEPOINTS` directory
    * Create a file in JSON format at constants.USC_RELEASEPOINT_JSON_PATH (`USC_RELEASEPOINTS/uscreleasepoints.json`)
    This JSON is an array of objects, each of the form:
    
    ```json
    {"name": "116-91", "date": "12/19/2019", "titlesAffected": ["18", "20", "26"], "url": "https://uscode.house.gov/download/releasepoints/us/pl/116/91/xml_uscAll@116-91.zip"}, 
    ```

## Load releasepoints into XCiteDB

`$ python loaduscxcite.py `

This reads the releasepoints list from `uscreleasepoints.json` and loads the titles from each directory to XCiteDB 

## Install a chronjob to download and update the USC nightly, if anything has changed

* Copy this directory (the top level `loadusc`) into `/main/loadusc` 
The path to `setup.py` will be `/main/loadusc/setup.py` and the shell script will be `/main/loadusc/updateusc.sh`

* Check if cron package is installed:

`$dpkg -l cron`  (Ubuntu)

* If cron is not installed, install the cron package:

`$ apt-get install cron` (Ubuntu)

* Verify if cron service is running:
`systemctl status cron`

* Configure cron job:

Edit `/etc/crontab` (`$ crontab -e`)
Add the following line to run the script every day at 2a.m.:

`0 2 * * * /path/to/updateusc.sh`
